&nbsp;	 *Performs the Topological intersection operation on the geometry set.
&nbsp;	 *@param input_geometries is the set of Geometry instances to be intersected by the intersector.
&nbsp;	 *@param intersector is the intersector Geometry. Only single intersector is used, therefore, the intersector.next() is called only once.
&nbsp;	 *@param sr The spatial reference is used to get tolerance value. Can be null, then the tolerance is not used and the operation is performed with
&nbsp;	 *a small tolerance value just enough to make the operation robust.
&nbsp;	 *@param progress_tracker Allows to cancel the operation. Can be null.
&nbsp;	 *@param dimensionMask The dimension of the intersection. The value is either -1, or a bitmask mask of values (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; dim).
&nbsp;	 *The value of -1 means the lower dimension in the intersecting pair.
&nbsp;	 *This is a fastest option when intersecting polygons with polygons or polylines.
&nbsp;	 *The bitmask of values (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; dim), where dim is the desired dimension value, is used to indicate
&nbsp;	 *what dimensions of geometry one wants to be returned. For example, to return
&nbsp;	 *multipoints and lines only, pass (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0) | (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1), which is equivalen to 1 | 2, or 3.
&nbsp;	 *@return Returns the cursor of the intersection result. The cursors&#39; getGeometryID method returns the current ID of the input geometry
&nbsp;	 *being processed. When dimensionMask is a bitmask, there will be n result geometries per one input geometry returned, where n is the number
&nbsp;	 *of bits set in the bitmask. For example, if the dimensionMask is 5, there will be two geometries per one input geometry.
&nbsp;	 *
&nbsp;	 *The operator intersects every geometry in the input_geometries with the first geometry of the intersector and returns the result.
&nbsp;	 *
&nbsp;	 *Note, when the dimensionMask is -1, then for each intersected pair of geometries,
&nbsp;	 *the result has the lower of dimentions of the two geometries. That is, the dimension of the Polyline/Polyline intersection
&nbsp;	 *is always 1 (that is, for polylines it never returns crossing points, but the overlaps only).
&nbsp;	 *If dimensionMask is 7, the operation will return any possible intersections.
